  ABSTRACT = {Bridging cultures that have often been distant, Julia combines expertise from the diverse fields of computer science and computational science to create a new approach to numerical computing. Julia is designed to be easy and fast and questions notions generally held to be “laws of nature" by practitioners of numerical computing: $\backslash$beginlist $\backslash$item High-level dynamic programs have to be slow. $\backslash$item One must prototype in one language and then rewrite in another language for speed or deployment. $\backslash$item There are parts of a system appropriate for the programmer, and other parts that are best left untouched as they have been built by the experts. $\backslash$endlist We introduce the Julia programming language and its design---a dance between specialization and abstraction. Specialization allows for custom treatment. Multiple dispatch, a technique from computer science, picks the right algorithm for the right circumstance. Abstraction, which is what good computation is really about, recognizes what remains the same after differences are stripped away. Abstractions in mathematics are captured as code through another technique from computer science, generic programming. Julia shows that one can achieve machine performance without sacrificing human convenience.},

  ABSTRACT = {In treating dynamic systems, sequential Monte Carlo methods use discrete samples to represent a complicated probability distribution and use rejection sampling, importance sampling and weighted resampling to complete the on-line 'filtering' task. We propose a special sequential Monte Carlo method, the mixture Kalman filter, which uses a random mixture of the Gaussian distributions to approximate a target distribution. It is designed for on-line estimation and prediction of conditional and partial conditional dynamic linear models, which are themselves a class of widely used non-linear systems and also serve to approximate many others. Compared with a few available filtering methods including Monte Carlo methods, the gain in efficiency that is provided by the mixture Kalman filter can be very substantial. Another contribution of the paper is the formulation of many non-linear systems into conditional or partial conditional linear form, to which the mixture Kalman filter can be applied. Examples in target tracking and digital communications are given to demonstrate the procedures proposed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Human infants have the remarkable ability to learn any human language. One proposed mechanism for this ability is distributional learning, where learners infer the underlying cluster structure from unlabeled input. Computational models of distributional learning have historically been principled but psychologically-implausible computational-level models, or ad hoc but psychologically plausible algorithmic-level models. Approximate rational models like particle ﬁlters can potentially bridge this divide, and allow principled, but psychologically plausible models of distributional learning to be speciﬁed and evaluated. As a proof of concept, I evaluate one such particle ﬁlter model, applied to learning English voicing categories from distributions of voice-onset times (VOTs). I ﬁnd that this model learns well, but behaves somewhat differently from the standard, unconstrained Gibbs sampler implementation of the underlying rational model.},

  ABSTRACT = {Beliefs are a fundamental component of our daily decisions, and as such, beliefs about our health have a huge impact on our health behaviors. Poor medication adherence is a welldocumented problem and while it has been extensively researched, it has yet to be addressed using a Bayesian framework. This study aims to use a mixture model to understand belief updating as it affects decision making. Using an established experimental paradigm in categorical perception, we test memory and prediction in order to establish a model that can explain human belief updating. Results indicate that a mixture model provides a good explanation of participant behavior in this paradigm.},

  ABSTRACT = {Two experiments (modeled after J. Deese's 1959 study) revealed remarkable levels of false recall and false recognition in a list learning paradigm. In Exp 1, Ss studied lists of 12 words (e.g., bed, rest, awake); each list was composed of associates of 1 nonpresented word (e.g., sleep). On immediate free recall tests, the nonpresented associates were recalled 40\% of the time and were later recognized with high confidence. In Exp 2, a false recall rate of 55\% was obtained with an expanded set of lists, and on a later recognition test, Ss produced false alarms to these items at a rate comparable to the hit rate. The act of recall enhanced later remembering of both studied and nonstudied material. The results reveal a powerful illusion of memory: People remember events that never happened.

  ABSTRACT = {Rational models of cognition typically consider the abstract computational problems posed by the environment, assuming that people are capable of optimally solving those problems. This differs from more traditional formal models of cognition, which focus on the psychological processes responsible for behavior. A basic challenge for rational models is thus explaining how optimal solutions can be approximated by psychological processes. We outline a general strategy for answering this question, namely to explore the psychological plausibility of approximation algorithms developed in computer science and statistics. In particular, we argue that Monte Carlo methods provide a source of rational process models that connect optimal solutions to psychological processes. We support this argument through a detailed example, applying this approach to Anderson's (1990, 1991) rational model of categorization (RMC), which involves a particularly challenging computational problem. Drawing on a connection between the RMC and ideas from nonparametric Bayesian statistics, we propose 2 alternative algorithms for approximate inference in this model. The algorithms we consider include Gibbs sampling, a procedure appropriate when all stimuli are presented simultaneously, and particle filters, which sequentially approximate the posterior distribution with a small number of samples that are updated as new data become available. Applying these algorithms to several existing datasets shows that a particle filter with a single particle provides a good description of human inferences.

  ABSTRACT = {$<$p$>$How do humans search for rewards? This question is commonly studied using multi-armed bandit tasks, which require participants to trade off exploration and exploitation. Standard multi-armed bandits assume that each option has an independent reward distribution. However, learning about options independently is unrealistic, since in the real world options often share an underlying structure. We introduce a class of structured bandit tasks, which we use to probe how generalization guides exploration. In a structured multi-armed bandit, options have a correlation structure dictated by a latent function. We focus on bandits in which rewards are linear functions of an option9s spatial position. Across 5 experiments, we find evidence that participants utilize functional structure to guide their exploration, and also exhibit a learning-to-learn effect across rounds, becoming progressively faster at identifying the latent function. The experiments rule out several heuristic explanations, and show that the same findings obtain with non-linear functions. Comparing several models of learning and decision making, we find that the best model of human behavior in our tasks combines three computational mechanisms: (1) function learning, (2) clustering of reward distributions across rounds, and (3) uncertainty-guided exploration. Our results suggest that human reinforcement learning can utilize latent structure in sophisticated ways to improve efficiency.$<$/p$>$},

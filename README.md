# Modeling memory for location with structured variation

## TODO

### Modeling

* Systematic parameter space investigation
* Prediction behavior
    * maybe relevant for stickiness...
* Compare to baselines:
    * non-sticky CRP (does stickiness actually help?)
    * true clusters (how does the ideal form of the thing we're approximating
      match human behavior?  also useful for getting better **prior parameters**)
    * changepoint model (does it help to go back to previous clusters?)
* Run on 2017 data, too
    * incl. random data (cf. baselines)

### Code

* refactor plotting to cut down on cut and paste plotting
